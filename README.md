â”œâ”€â”€ Base.py              # Base classes for network components (layer templates, core functionality)  
â”œâ”€â”€ FullyConnected.py    # Implements fully connected/dense layers (input/output size configurable)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Loss.py             # Loss functions: CrossEntropy (classification), MSE (regression)  
â”œâ”€â”€ NeuralNetwork.py    # Main class to assemble layers into a trainable network  
â”œâ”€â”€ Optimizers.py       # Gradient descent optimizers: SGD (with momentum), Adam  
â”œâ”€â”€ ReLU.py            # Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation layer implementation  
â””â”€â”€ SoftMax.py         # Softmax activation for multi-class classification outputs  





## âœ¨ Features

- **Modular Design**: Each component (layers, activations, losses) is independently usable
- **PyTorch Integration**: Leverages PyTorch's automatic differentiation
- **Flexible Architectures**: Easily configurable hidden layers and sizes
- **Multiple Activations**: ReLU and Softmax included
- **Extensible**: Add new layers or losses with base class templates

## ðŸš€ Installation
